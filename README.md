# NOTE!
This is just a repository of psxfunkin stuff I felt like doing.
The stuff in here might be used in an actual port, or it might not.
Also, most of the stuff in here I did not get permission to do, so if you see something you made in here, and don't like it being here, let me know and I'll take it down right away.
Where thiis content came from, and where you can play the original content will be below.

Oh yeah, and if YOU are making a psx port (with permission from the og creators) and want to use something from this repository, you can use it, just credit me.
